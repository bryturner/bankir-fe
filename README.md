## Possible Features

- Restrict users from making multiple transactions/transfers at the same time on different devices. MongoDB provides this service, but it is above the tier Iâ€™m using.
- Automatically update the accounts every month by adding earned interest
- Enabling users to set up automatic transfers/transactions
